Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. This tutorial will give you a great understanding on Data Structures needed to understand the complexity of enterprise level applications and need of algorithms, and data structures.

We hope to cover following data structures and algorithms using C and java for now. :-)

* Arrays
* Stacks
* Lists
* Trees
* Sorting and searching
* Priority Queues
